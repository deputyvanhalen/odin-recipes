        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Pasta carbonara...or spaghetti carbonara if you're a traditionalist is a timeless classic.
            If you're going to make it, you need to make it right. So why not follow the New York Times
            recipe which does its best to be as authentic as possible. Sure you can use a different pasta,
            or pancetta instead of guanciale...but then what you have is NOT carbonara. When it comes to the
            five roman pastas, know the rules, follow the rules, and do NOT deviate. Otherwise you're not making
            the dish.
